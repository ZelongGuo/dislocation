Mind the unit: recommend the International System of Units.

Though strain is a dimensionless quantity, specifying dislocation unit same with fault parameters would help avoid further transformation.

## compile (by shared library/dynamic link library, dll)

```bash
# Using gcc compiler
gcc abc123.c -shared -o abc123.so -I<numpy_include_dir> -I<python_include_dir> -L<python_lib_dir> -l<python_lib_name>

# for instance:
(temp) âžœ ~/codes/CExtension gcc abc123.c -shared -o abc123.so -I/Users/zelong/opt/miniconda3/envs/temp/lib/python3.11/site-packages/numpy/core/include -I/Users/zelong/opt/miniconda3/envs/temp/include/python3.11 -L/Users/zelong/opt/miniconda3/envs/temp/lib -lpython3.11

# It will produce a .so files in the current directory, and under current directory, you could import the module in the corresponding python interpreter.
```

```bash
# build shared library in current directory otherwise in ./build
python setup.py build --build-lib ./
```
or equivalently using gcc or clang:
```bash
# -undefined dynamic_looku is essential for undefined symbols
gcc/clang src/dislocation.c src/okada_dc3d.c src/okada_disloc3d.c -fPIC -O2 -I/Users/zelong/opt/miniconda3/envs/temp/lib/python3.11/site-packages/numpy/core/include -I/Users/zelong/opt/miniconda3/envs/temp/include/python3.11 -shared -undefined dynamic_lookup -o dislocation.so
```
